# Spring Security Java Application

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement **Spring Security** for authentication and authorization in a Spring Boot application. The project is built with Java and uses Spring Security to secure endpoints and manage user roles.

## Features
- User Authentication using Spring Security
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Updated deprecated Spring Security methods to the latest ones
- Integration with OAuth2.0 and Keycloak for authentication (optional)

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed before running the project:
- Java 17 or later
- Maven
- Spring Boot 3.2.2 or later
- A running instance of Keycloak (if using OAuth2)
- Docker

## References
For this project, I referred to the courses by Bouali Ali and Sergio Lema. I updated deprecated methods with the latest alternatives and implemented several other improvements based on the course content.
